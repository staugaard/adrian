# Adrian

# Moved to: https://github.com/zendesk/adrian

Adrian is a work dispatcher and some queue implementations.
Adrian does not do any real work, but is really good at delegating it.
Adrian **does not care how** real work get's done, but **makes damn sure that it does get done**.

## Installation
